# Django Booking App

Welcome to my Django Booking App! This project has been in continuous development as I enhance its features and usability. It's designed to provide a seamless booking experience for businesses and their customers.

## Overview

The Django Booking App allows businesses, companies, or individuals to create and manage their own booking systems, hosted on my platform. Key features include:
- **Business Sign-up and Dashboard:** Businesses can sign up, create a custom booking system, and manage their bookings via a dedicated dashboard. They can share the booking link or embed it directly on their own websites (embedded pages donâ€™t include a navbar for a seamless experience).
- **Customer Bookings:** Customers can book either as guests or registered users. Registered users benefit from a personalized homepage where they can manage their bookings (edit, delete, etc.).
- **Payments & Email Confirmations:** Payments are securely processed through **Stripe**, and booking confirmations are sent via **Brevo**. Email verification is also part of the sign-up process to ensure authenticity.
- **User Management:** Businesses can create, view, edit, and delete bookings and update facility details, while users can manage their individual bookings.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Django Framework**: Core backend development.
- **Stripe Integration**: For secure payment processing.
- **Brevo**: Email service for confirmations and verification.
- **PythonAnywhere Hosting**: Currently hosted at [noahcoding.pythonanywhere.com](http://noahcoding.pythonanywhere.com).

## How to Use
- **For Businesses:** Sign up, create your booking system, and manage your bookings through the business dashboard.
- **For Customers:** Make bookings as a guest or sign up for an account to gain access to a homepage where you can manage your bookings.
- **Check it out:** On the homepage there is an example system to check out, feel free to check out as a guest using any random email, and using card details- Number:4242 4242 4242 4242 Expiry:1035 Cvv:123
